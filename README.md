# REAL-TIME-FLIGHT-DATA-MONITORING-SYSTEM
n the internship I understood working principle Real time flight data monitoring system and evaluated the performance of the system. Also got an opportunity to interact with all the team members and found that the critical parameters from sensor’s output of the aircraft are acquired and the desired parameter is based on the pilot’s choice is displayed and analyzed. The data is acquired and analyzed using data acquisition system and the required Configurations are done in kWorkbench software for analysis of parameters. The frame is built in kWorkbench for analyzing the parameters in Quicklook real time and MSO. The programme for PCM frame detection is implemented in Keil uVision and is debugged for checking whether the data is synchronized with the system
